Design
------

> Explain how you would periodically scan the `root` the directory and detect
> if a file has been created, modified, or removed.
>
>   1. What system calls would you need to use?
>
>   2. What information would you need to store and what data structures would
>      you need?

.

> Explain how you would check if a rule matched an event and execute the
> corresponding action.
>
>   1. What system calls would you need to use?
>
>   2. How would you pass the environment variables to the command?

.

> Explain how you would handle a [SIGINT] signal and what you would need to
> cleanup?
>
>   1. What system calls would you need to use?
>
>   2. How would you know what resources to cleanup?

Testing
-------

> Describe how you tested and verified that `rorschach` met the project
> requirements.

Analysis
--------

> How is what `rorschach` does similar to how a [system call] operates?

.

> As described in the project requirements, `rorschach` periodically scans the
> `root` directory to detect changes in files.  This process can be described
> as a form of [busy waiting].
>
>   1. In this specific context, why could this be considered a possible
>      negative design flaw?
>
>   2. Consider [inotify(7)] provided by [Linux].  How would these system calls
>      help address the problem of [busy waiting]?
>
>   3. Why might we still consider using [busy waiting] as specified in the
>      original design rather than use something like [inotify(7)]?
